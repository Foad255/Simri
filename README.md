Simri: AI-Powered MRI Similarity Search for Faster Insights

The traditional diagnostic journey can mean weeks or months of uncertainty, a heavy emotional burden for patients and their families.

The Problem: From Scan to Diagnosis
When a brain tumor is suspected, the path to understanding is often slow and filled with anxiety. After an MRI, patients can wait weeks for detailed analysis and to understand their prognosis. This waiting period is a major challenge, leaving them with unanswered questions and significant stress. How aggressive is the tumor? Has anyone had something that looks like this before? What can I expect?


Simri empowers patients and clinicians by providing instant, data-driven insights from visually similar cases.

The Solution: Introducing Simri ðŸ’¡
Simri bridges the gap between the initial scan and deep insights. It's a powerful research platform that uses state-of-the-art AI to instantly find similar patient cases from a vast medical imaging database based on the unique features of a tumor's MRI scans.

Instead of waiting, imagine uploading an MRI and immediately seeing visually similar cases, complete with their diagnostic information. This accelerates understanding, aids research, and provides a data-driven foundation for discussion, turning weeks of uncertainty into moments of clarity.

Key Features âœ¨
ðŸ§  AI-Powered Similarity: Utilizes a custom deep learning model (TIEP) to generate a unique "embedding" or fingerprint for each patient's multi-sequence MRI.

âš¡ Blazing Fast Search: Leverages MongoDB's Vector Search to instantly find the closest matching patient profiles in a large database.

ðŸ“‚ Secure MRI Upload: Easily upload the five key MRI sequences (t1ce, t1n, t2f, t2w, and seg) directly to the platform.

ðŸ“Š Interactive Visualization: View and compare MRI scans side-by-side using the integrated Niivue web-based medical image viewer.

ðŸ”¬ Explore BraTS Dataset: The platform is pre-loaded with data from the BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) challenge, providing a rich repository for comparison.

How It Works
The process is designed to be seamless, transforming raw MRI files into actionable, comparative insights.

The user uploads MRI files via the Next.js frontend.

Files are securely uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket.

The file locations are sent to the Hugging Face backend API, where the TIEP model processes the images and generates a vector embedding.

This embedding is used to perform a similarity search against the MongoDB Atlas vector database to retrieve the most similar patient records.
